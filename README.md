# flat-tailsitter

Status: **Work in Progress**

This project explores the simulation and control of a 2D tailsitter. It has the aspiration to one day become a full 3-D visualization, hence some of the types are written to be extensible to that.

The goal is to do minimum-energy trajectory planning.
